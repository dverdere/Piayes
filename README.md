###EECS 481 - Winter 2017 <br>
Brad's DAW Group 1 - *Piayes* <br> Akansha Agarwal, Lillian Seo, Pedro Fialho, Yelena Pham <br> Beta Release <br> <br>

####What is *Piayes*<br>
*Piayes* is an audio recording and editing application that provides an easy alternative for a user to create a song.<br>
Step 1: the user records a melody without worrying about the tempo/rhythm of the song.<br>
Step 2: the user records the desired tempo and length of each of the notes previously played by using any key on the keyboard.<br>
Step 3: the application will map the keys from step 1 to the timestamps from step 2 and output the resulting song.<br>
*Note that audio output will only be available on the Beta release.<br><br>

####Deploying *Piayes*<br>
Run the provided executable.

####Using *Piayes*<br>
1. Connect a MIDI keyboard to your machine or use the piano user interface.<br>
2. Click on the **Record** button and select the **Set Notes** mode to save the keys of the notes played.<br>
3. The application will save and output the keys, but not the timestamps, of all the notes played.<br>
4. Click on **Playback Notes** to output the keys of all the notes recorded so far.<br>
5. Select **Set Rhythm** mode to save the key-down and key-up timestamps of all the notes played.<br>
6. The application will save and output the timestamps, but not the keys, of all the notes played.<br> 
7. Click on **Stop Recording** and then **Combine Tracks** to output the keys mapped to the desired rhythm.<br>
8. Note that the same number of notes should be played on the two modes for the application to work correctly.<br>
9. You may stop recording and delete everything at any point by clicking on **Clear Recording**.<br>

####Combining with *B.R.A.D.* <br>
In the Beta release we have aimed to combine our groups together in order to give Brad a better playing experience. After working and learning our systems for the alpha release we met up and made the decision that it was best for Team B.R.A.D. to take their ideas and their code and integrate it into Team Piayes' project (and git hub repo) since going the other way would have been substantially more difficult and would only result in a slightly better design. We felt that in the end our product should be focused on creating something to help Brad play again and not on splitting things in such a way that each groups contributions are easily identifiable all at the cost of making it harder to use. <br> 
While Team Piayes will continuing to focus on the editing features outlined above, Team B.R.A.D. will focus on the "live" playing aspects, including volume control, octave switching, and chord triggering. <br>
